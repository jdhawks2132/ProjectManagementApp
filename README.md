## Live Deployment Links

## About

FIS-Assist was designed as a communication tool for Flation students during their Pre-Work phase.

## Learning Goals

During my Flatiron curriculum, we learn Sinatra/Active Record and Ruby on Rails as backend frameworks. Both of which utilize SQL databases and I wanted to explore a NoSQL platform like Google Firebase. This app was created using Firestore as a backend and also integrates Firebase Authorization, Storage and Hosting. Since then, I have created several small projects with NoSQL/ Cloud-based hosting. 

## Project Planning

- Frontend 
  - The user can create a log in or sign in if they are a returning user. 
  - The user can see a collection of all open questions on a dashboard.
  - The user can submit their own questions.
  - The user can click on a question to see a chat dialog about their question or other questions.
  - The user can filter questions by module.
  - Sidebar will display user's name and avatar during the session.
  - Chat sidebar will display other user's log-in status and names/ avatars

- Backend: Google Firebase
  - Authentication
  - Storage
  - Hosting
